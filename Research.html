          <p>I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Neuroscience Statistics Research Lab at Harvard Medical School / Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT, in Professor Emery Brown's lab. I am also affiliated with the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. I am funded by a NIH F32 Ruth L. Kirschstein Fellowship through the NIA.</p>



<strong>Research focus: mathematical foundations of circadian rhythms</strong>

		<p>The circadian oscillator is a biological control system designed to regulate gene expression in a 24-hour periodic environment. The gene regulatory network comprising the circadian oscillator may be modeled through systems of coupled chemical reactions. Mathematically, these reactions may be described as a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations, or in some cases, as a probabilistic chemical master equation. I use mathematical modeling and statistics tools inside an empiricist framework to better understand circadian phenomena. </p>
		<p>There are two foci within my work. First, I study how different organisms generate oscillation within individual cells, coordinate those oscillations across tissues or populations, and how signals confer information about the temporal environment.  I additionally study the development algorithms and techniques for medical manipulation of circadian processes. For a list of relevant publications, please see my CV.</p>

I am fortunate to have a fantastic group of <strong>collaborators</strong>:
<ul>
  <li>Filipa Rijo-Ferreira and Joseph S. Takahashi, UT Southwestern/Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Project: Etiology of diurnal rhythms in the malaria parasite</li>
  <li>Yongli Shan and Joseph S. Takahashi, UT Southwestern/Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Project: Examining cell-type-specific roles in population synchrony using a novel Cre-inducible color-switching bioluminescence reporter </li>
  <li>Stephanie R. Taylor, Colby College. Project: Modeling the roles of AVP and VIP in the SCN</li>
</ul>
as well as prior collaborations:
<ul>
    <li>Cristina Mazuski and Erik D. Herzog, WUSTL. Project: Examining the role of electrical activity and VIP release in circadian rhythms</li>
    <li>Vania Carmona-Alcocer and Erik D. Herzog, WUSTL. Project: Ontogeny of circadian rhythms in the mouse SCN</li>
    <li>Daniel Granados-Fuentes and Erik D. Herzog, WUSTL. Project: Inference of network connections within the SCN</li>
</ul>

<strong>Research focus: the anesthetized brain</strong><br>
<p>General anesthesia is a state of unconsciousness, analgesia, and amnesia that is routinely induced for many medical procedures.
My postdoctoral research is concentrated on understanding the brain under anesthesia, especially during aging. I am developing statistical, machine learning, and controls approaches for guiding anesthesia and improving clinical practice. For a list of relevant publications, please see my CV.</p>
<p>The majority of this work is performed in collaboration with the rest of the Neuroscience Statistics Research Laboratory at MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital. I additionally collaborate with Balachundhar Subramaniam at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.</p>
