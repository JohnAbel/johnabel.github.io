        <small>
          <p>I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Neuroscience Statistics Research Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT, in Professor Emery Brown's lab. I am also a NIH T32 trainee in sleep, circadian, and respiratory neurobiology at Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women's Hospital.</p>

          <strong>Postdoctoral research: under construction</strong><br>
<p>General anesthesia is a state of unconsciousness, analgesia, and amnesia that is routinely induced for many medical procedures.
My postdoctoral research is concentrated on understanding the brain under anesthesia, especially during aging. As I delve deeper into this field, more information will be added here.</p>

<strong>Doctoral (and ongoing) research: mammalian circadian rhythms</strong>

		<p>The circadian oscillator is a biological control system designed to regulate gene expression in a 24-hour periodic environment. The gene regulatory network comprising the circadian oscillator may be modeled through systems of coupled chemical reactions. Mathematically, these reactions may be described as a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations, or in some cases, as a probabilistic chemical master equation. My doctoral research involves using modeling as well as dynamical systems and control theory to better understand mammalian circadian rhythms. There are two main foci within my work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understanding interactions between the genetic oscillator and electrical and chemical neurotransmission in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (collaborators: Herzog lab, WUSTL; Takahashi lab, UTSW)</li>
  <li>Developing algorithms and techniques for control of circadian rhythms (collaborators: Klerman lab, Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women's Hospital)</li>
</ul>
Selected publications on these topics are below. For a full list of publications, see my CV.<br>
