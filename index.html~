      <section>
        <p>Welcome! I am currently a PhD student in Systems Biology at Harvard University.
        This page exists primarily to host details about my academic interests.</p>
        <p class="view">In general, my research lies at the interface of systems biology, complex dynamical systems, and control theory. You can read about my <a href="Research.html">research interests and ongoing projects here</a>. Much of my research is focused on the mammalian circadian oscillator and the relationship between its biological function and its mathematical structure. Where relevant, links to the associated publications and/or GitHub repositories containing code or data are provided.</p>

        <p>For a more formal introduction, here is <a href="cv/abel-cv.pdf">my CV</a>, or, you can <a href="https://github.com/JohnAbel">view my GitHub profile</a> for ongoing and archival projects.</p>
        
        <p>On a more personal note, I spend some of my non-working hours powerlifting (currently running a custom 5x5) and, recently, abstract painting.</p>
